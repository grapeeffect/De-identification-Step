# De-identification and K-Anonymity
This project will make preparation for data mining and analysis in recommendation letters. The preparation includes applicants' private information preprocessing and de-identification of letters. This repository is a python implementation for this purpose. 
There are two main steps for de-identification procedure:
(1) Letters Anonymization
(2) Applicants' Information Attributes Anonymization

## File Description
### Usage and Parameters
The PDFToText.py will help transfer a directory of PDF files to another directory of TEXT files. This implemention is from here [1].

The de-identify.py provides functions implemented on the Letters Anonymization. The function `remSpecChar()` deals with spectial characters 

### Instructions




### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
