# De-identification and K-Anonymity
This project will make preparation for data mining and analysis in recommendation letters. The preparation includes applicants' private information preprocessing and de-identification of letters. This repository is a python implementation for this purpose. 

There are two main steps for de-identification procedure:

(1) Letters Anonymization

(2) Applicants' Information Attributes Anonymization

## File Description
The list of files:
* K-Anonymity.py
* De-identify.py
* PDFToText.py

The PDFToText.py will help transfer a directory of PDF files to another directory of TEXT files. This implemention is from here [1].
### Usage and Parameters
