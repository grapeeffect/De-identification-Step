_PN_ _PN_ worked as a human resources coordinator for two years in my department at 
_CP_ _PN_. _CP_ that time, _PN_ has diverse responsibilities. She reviewed resumes to 
identify qualified employment candidates, conducted preliminary applicant interviews, and 
documented hiring-firing policy decisions for distribution to _CP_ various department 
supervisors.  
 
_PN_ is bright, articulate, and hard working. Her enthusiasm for the job comes through in all she 
does. She has a positive attitude that makes her a pleasure to work with and is one of the reasons 
she was so well-like by her coworkers.  
 
I highly recommend _PN_ for any job she is considering in the _PN_ _CP_ field. She would 
be an asset to any employer. If you have further questions about _PN_, please do not hesitate to

Sincerely,
