Sandra Braxton worked as a human resources coordinator for two years in my department at 
Fennel Corp. During that time, Sandra has diverse responsibilities. She reviewed resumes to 
identify qualified employment candidates, conducted preliminary applicant interviews, and 
documented hiring-firing policy decisions for distribution to Fennel’s various department 
supervisors.  
 
Sandra is bright, articulate, and hard working. Her enthusiasm for the job comes through in all she 
does. She has a positive attitude that makes her a pleasure to work with and is one of the reasons 
she was so well-like by her coworkers.  
 
I highly recommend Sandra for any job she is considering in the Human Resources field. She would 
be an asset to any employer. If you have further questions about Sandra, please do not hesitate to 
contact me at (404) 55-1121, ext 200 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
 
Kenneth Swipe 
Vice President, Human Resources
